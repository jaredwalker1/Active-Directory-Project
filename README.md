<h1>Active Directory Project</h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
Project consisted of setting up an Active Directory (home lab) that includes Splunk, Kali Linux & Atomic Red Team. Explored how a domain environment works, learned how to ingest events to a SIEM and generated telemetry related to attacks seen in the wild to help detect them in the future.

<h2>Objective</h2>
The objective of the lab is to provide a hands-on learning experience in setting up a virtualized environment for cybersecurity testing and exploration. By installing and configuring multiple virtual machines (VMs) including Windows 10, Debian, Windows Server 2022, and Ubuntu Server, the lab aims to teach skills such as network configuration, security tool installation (Splunk, Sysmon), endpoint monitoring, and security testing (using Crowbar and Hydra for brute force attacks). Joining Windows machines to an Active Directory domain and enabling Remote Desktop also adds to the learning objectives. PowerShell scripting is used for automation tasks. Overall, the lab enables participants to gain practical experience in cybersecurity concepts, tools, and techniques within a controlled environment.
